## Course Description

This subject examines media audiences—specifically, fans—and the subcultures that evolve around them. Explores practices and products of fan culture, i.e., clubs, fiction, activism, etc. Readings and assignments place these practices and products within the context of various disciplines. This subject requires three short papers and presentations. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.

A former student [blogged about her participation](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cms-621-fans-fan-culture/) in this class and included video of her three oral presentations. Her narrative is useful if you are curious about the class. 

## Decorum

1. Be on time, and treat your fellow students as you wish to be treated. Show respect and sensitivity for your fellow students, especially those with whom you disagree.
2. Do not be shy about asking questions. If anyone uses an unfamiliar word or makes a political, historical, or cultural reference that is obscure, ask about it!
3. In the unlikely scenario that we need to hold some classes via Zoom, please keep your video cameras *on* and treat others as you would if we were meeting in person.

## Acknowledgement

The course was created by the “Father” of Fan Studies in CMS, Professor Henry Jenkins, now at the University of Southern California. The design and syllabus content are my own creations, but they are influenced by earlier instructors’ syllabi by Jenkins and by Flourish Klink (SM, Comparative Media Studies, 2010) and enriched by suggestions by Liz and Lauren Murray. My thanks to all of them.
